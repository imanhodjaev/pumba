Pumba helps you

1. To load user agent strings for different browsers,
2. Keep in-memory state,
3. Randomly fetch any user agent,
4. Profit - Hakuna Matata :)

## Use cases ðŸ”®

You might want to use `Pumba`

1. To simulate real user agent when requesting website or resource,
2. To use in tandem with crawlers to randomly swap user agent strings,
3. Build REST API or any API on top of it or expose as a service,
4. Many other use cases I'm not aware (open issue to share one).

## Installation ðŸ’¾

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `pumba` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs` and if needed please add to
application list to start:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:pumba, "~> 0.0.1"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage ðŸ§ 

### Load user agents

To load user agent strings for a given browser you need to call

```ex
iex> Pumba.Load("Firefox")
:ok
```

### Get random user agent

To load user agent strings for a given browser you need to call

```ex
iex> Pumba.random()
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux ppc64le; rv:75.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/75.0
```

### Set custom client

There are two ways to set custom client first is via config second is overriding manually

Configuration

```ex
config :pumba,
  client: MyAwesomeClient
```

Runtime

```ex
iex> Pumba.UserAgents.set_client(MyAwesomeClient)
```

### Create custom client

If you want to have your own client then it should implement `Pumba.Client` behaviour.
